Greetings 👋🏼 - my name is Marian and I like collecting useful resources and making lists 📑🤓.

This repository contains the full collection of my resource pages created in [Craft](https://www.craft.do/) and is a work in progress. Should you have any suggestions for content I should add, I invite you to [raise an issue](https://github.com/meerens/dataviz-design-resources/issues/new) so I can review and add to my collection if relevant.
